# My Portfolio
This is my portfolio of projects. Included in it are: 

1. "A Medieval Adventure" - A fantasy text based game made in python. This was some of my first experience coding during my freshman year.
2. "A war among Stars" is a star wars/space invader type game I made/am making in python. This was my first time making something on my own accord. It is very simple, yet I learned a lot about the process it takes to create and manage a project. The code is very sloppy, unorganized, and inefficient however I enjoy the time I spend working on it. 
3. "Task Manager" - A task management app I worked on, I was able to include adding/removing tasks, status, completed tasks lists, all with a simple UI and a saved database of the tasks. 
4. "301 Java Assignments" - Assignments from a programming class I took that showcase experience in Java.
