# portfolio
This is my portfolio of projects and assignments. Included in it are

1. "A Medieval Adventure" - A fantasy text based game made in python. This was some of my first experience coding during my freshman year.
2. "A war among Stars" is a star wars/space invader type game I made/am making in python. This was my first time making something on my own accord. It is very simple, yet I learned a lot about the process it takes to create and manage a project. The code is very sloppy, unorganized, and inefficient however I enjoy the time I spend working on it. 
3. "Task_m - A task management app I am currently wokring on, I hope to include adding/removing tasks, status, completed tasks lists, all with a simple UI and a saved database of the tasks.
