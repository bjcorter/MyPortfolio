# portfolio
This is my portfolio of projects and assignments. Included in it are

1. A fantasy text based game made in python. This was some of my first experience coding during my freshman year.
2. "A war among Stars" is a star wars/space invader type game I made/am making in python. This was my first time making something on my own accord. It is very simple, yet I learned a lot about the process it takes to create and manage a project.
